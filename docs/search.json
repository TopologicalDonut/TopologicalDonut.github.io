    "text": "Quantifying Heterogeneity of Discrimination in the Canadian Labor Market\nThis is a mini-research paper that was done as my capstone project for my MA in economics at Simon Fraser University; we were given 4 months to develop a research question and write a paper answering it. I applied a causal machine learning algorithm (causal forest) to a dataset from Oreopoulos (2011) that contains information on artificial resumes that were sent out to Canadian employers roughly 10 years ago. I used various transformations and visualizations of the algorithm outputs to quantify how different groups of minorities are impacted by discrimination in the labor market.\nLink to paper  Source code \n\n\nVancouver Crime Analysis\nThis is an analysis of how daylight savings time (DST) affects crime in Vancouver.

    "text": "All the data and raw code of this post can be found here\nMost of us probably hate Daylight Savings Time (DST) – at least, I know I certainly do. A natural question that I’ve found myself asking is whether there’s any benefit to DST aside from its intended purpose.\nIt turns out that some researchers have had the same question. Doleac and Sanders (2015) found that DST caused a notable decrease in crime rates in the United States. Unfortunately, the results likely cannot be generalized to outside the United States since the mechanism through which DST affects crime rates is by increasing the average amount of ambient light during a typical day. This might lead to a higher chance of criminals being caught, thus potentially lowering crime rates. However, it’s also possible that this higher level of ambient light causes people to spend more time outdoors, resulting in more potential victims for criminals. There’s many other reasons why we might not see a decrease in crime rates from DST in other countries as well: different baseline levels of ambient light, different infrastructure, different crime patterns, and so on.\nSince I happen to live in Vancouver, I’ll use a similar methodology to that of Doleac and Sanders (2015) to analyze whether DST has a comparable effect on crime rates in Vancouver.\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nlibrary(sandwich)\nlibrary(lmtest)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n# ---- Light/dark mode stuff ----\n\ntheme_light &lt;- function() {\n  theme_stata(scheme = \"s1color\")\n}\n\ntheme_dark &lt;- function() {\n  theme_stata(scheme = \"s1rcolor\")\n}\n\ndarksvglite &lt;- function(file, width, height) {\n  on.exit(reset_theme_settings())\n  theme_set(theme_dark())\n  ggsave(\n    filename = file,\n    width = width,\n    height = height,\n    dev = \"svg\",\n    bg = \"transparent\"\n  )\n}\n\n# ---- Functions for Analysis ----\n\n#' This function fits a linear regression designed to estimate the effect of\n#' `dst_dummy` on the specified outcome.
