    "text": "Quantifying Heterogeneity of Discrimination in the Canadian Labor Market\nThis is a mini-research paper that was done as my capstone project for the MA in economics at Simon Fraser University. I applied a causal machine learning algorithm (causal forest) to a dataset from Oreopoulos (2011) that contains information on artificial resumes that were sent out to Canadian employers roughly 10 years ago. I used various transformations and visualizations of the algorithm outputs to quantify how different groups of minorities are impacted by discrimination in the labor market.\nLink to paper  Source code \n\n\nVancouver Crime Analysis\nThis is an analysis of how daylight savings time (DST) affects crime in Vancouver. Inspired by Doleac and Sanders (2015), I applied a regression discontinuity design with the running variable being days from DST.\nLink to report  Source code \n\n\nUK Tax Policy Analysis\nThis is an analysis of how the 2021 UK tampon tax abolition affected tampon prices using an event study. I used a regression with ARIMA errors to account for the time series nature of price data.\nLink to report  Source code \n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDoleac, Jennifer L., and Nicholas J.
