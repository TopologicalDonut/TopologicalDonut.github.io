# Quantifying Heterogeneity of Discrimination in the Canadian Labor Market

This is a mini-research paper that was done as my capstone project for my MA in economics at Simon Fraser University; we were given 4 months to develop a research question and write a paper answering it. I applied a causal machine learning algorithm (causal forest) to a dataset from @oreopoulos2011 that contains information on artificial resumes that were sent out to Canadian employers roughly 10 years ago. I used various transformations and visualizations of the algorithm outputs to quantify how different groups of minorities are impacted by discrimination in the labor market.

# Vancouver Crime Analysis

This is an analysis of how daylight savings time (DST) affects crime in Vancouver. Inspired by @doleac2015, I applied a regression discontinuity design with the running variable being days from DST.

# UK Tax Policy Analysis

This is an analysis of how the 2021 UK tampon tax abolition affected tampon prices using an event study. I used a regression with ARIMA errors to account for the time series nature of price data.
